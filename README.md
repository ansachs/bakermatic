# Bake A Cake App

My first app in Java. A CLI app that reads ingredients and cakes from a JSON file then allows the user to 'purchase' these cakes. The resulting inventory is shown on each iteration and when inventory is out, a warning is given to the user. The user can restock the inventory.

## Getting Started

`compile with javac and run with java -jar`

**Tip 1:** enter the number of the cake to purchase

**Tip 2:** enter 'r' to restock the inventory

**Tip 3:** enter 'q' to quit the application

## Running the tests

can be run from command line with junit.jar
